# ChatGPT Testing

This project is a testing suite for the ChatGPT API, which is a natural language processing API for generating human-like text. The project allows you to traverse a directory structure, send the contents of each file to the ChatGPT API, and receive a description of the project from the API. The description can then be used as a README file for the project repository.

To use the testing suite, you will need to provide your ChatGPT API credentials as environment variables: `OPENAI_EMAIL` and `OPENAI_PASSWORD`. You can then start the project using `npm start`. This will initiate a conversation with the ChatGPT API and provide it with the contents of each file in the project. When you are ready to generate the README, send the message "generate README" to the API. The API will use the information provided to generate a description of the project, which will be printed to the console.

The project consists of several TypeScript modules. The `chatgptService.ts` module contains the `ChatGptService` class, which provides a wrapper for the ChatGPT API. The `index.ts` module is the entry point for the project. It uses the `ChatGptService` and `Traverser` classes to traverse the directory structure and send the contents of each file to the API.

The `prompter.ts` module contains the `Prompter` class, which sends messages to the ChatGPT API and handles the responses. The `traverser.ts` module contains the `Traverser` class, which traverses a directory structure and performs a specific action on each file that is encountered.

The `tsconfig.json` file is the configuration file for the TypeScript compiler. It specifies the options to use when compiling TypeScript code into JavaScript code.

The `package.json` file includes the dependencies and scripts for the project. The `nodemon.json` file specifies the configuration for the `nodemon` development server, which can be used to automatically restart the application when changes are made to the code.

To install the dependencies for the project, run `npm install` in the root directory of the project.
